## Overview

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) provides the tools and infrastructure
you need to develop your app, grow your user base, and earn money. The Firebase
Admin Rust SDK enables access to Firebase services from privileged environments
(such as servers or cloud) in Rust.

For more information, visit the
[Firebase Admin SDK setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup/).

environments.
